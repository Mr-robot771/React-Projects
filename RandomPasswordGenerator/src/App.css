  Educational comments: This project uses Tailwind for the majority of styling.
  The purpose of this file is to show a few small, non-Tailwind helpers and
  provide inline comments so you can learn how the responsive layout was adjusted.

  Notes:
  - Most responsiveness is handled by Tailwind utility classes used in JSX.
  - We add only a tiny helper here to ensure the range input and text behave
    more consistently across browsers.

/* Make sure range input doesn't overflow its container on very small screens */
input[type="range"] {
  max-width: 100%;
}

/* Allow the readonly text input to truncate with an ellipsis on overflow */
input[readonly] {
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
